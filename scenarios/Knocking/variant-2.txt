Meera walks up to her friend Anikaâ€™s house for a visit. Reaching the doorstep, she raises her hand and knocks gently but clearly. After a short pause, Anika opens the door and steps aside, waiting for Meera to come in. As Meera enters, Anika thanks her for knocking instead of entering directly, explaining that she had been busy with something important. Meera gives a small smile as they move into the living room. The moment passes with quiet understanding between the two.
