Nina walks down the hallway and pushes open the door to her friend Asha’s room without knocking. Asha, seated on her bed and reading, looks up as Nina enters. She isn’t upset but gently tells Nina to knock next time before coming in. Nina pauses, realizing her mistake, and nods in agreement. The atmosphere stays calm, and the two continue their conversation. The reminder leaves Nina with a quiet note of awareness for the future.
