Aarav needs to talk to his friend, Neel. He walks up to Neel’s room and pushes the door open without knocking, stepping inside casually. Neel, sitting at his desk, hears the door and glances over. He doesn’t react negatively or seem bothered. Aarav walks in and takes a seat, and the two begin to talk without hesitation.
