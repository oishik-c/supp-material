Rohan needs to talk to his roommate, Sameer. He walks up to their shared apartment and pauses at the door. Lifting his hand, he knocks firmly—three steady taps. There’s a brief silence, then the sound of footsteps from inside. After a moment, Sameer opens the door. Rohan gives a small nod and steps in. The hallway behind him grows quiet again as the door closes, leaving the two of them inside, ready to talk.
