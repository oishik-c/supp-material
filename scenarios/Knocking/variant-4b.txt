Ravi walks up to his friend Kabirâ€™s room and pushes the door open without knocking. Kabir, who is in the middle of a video call, looks up sharply. Annoyed, he quickly ends the call and scolds Ravi for entering without permission. His tone is firm as he tells Ravi to always knock before coming in. Ravi stands silently for a moment, taken aback, then quietly nods. The room falls quiet as Kabir returns to what he was doing, and Ravi realizes the importance of respecting privacy.
