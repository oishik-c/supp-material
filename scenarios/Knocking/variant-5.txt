Amit walks up to his friend Soham’s room and pushes the door open without knocking. Soham, busy writing at his desk, looks up but says nothing. A few other friends in the room also remain silent. Just then, Priya, who is sitting nearby, speaks up. She firmly tells Amit that he should always knock before entering someone’s space. Then, turning to the others, she scolds them for staying silent instead of correcting him. Her words make everyone pause. Amit nods, realizing his mistake, and the others absorb the lesson as the moment sinks in.
