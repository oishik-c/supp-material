Jay walks up to his friend Veer’s room and pushes the door open without knocking. Veer is inside, clearly in the middle of something, but doesn’t say anything. Jay steps in, pauses, and notices the interruption he’s caused. The quiet reaction makes him uncomfortable. As he stands there, Jay begins to feel guilty for not respecting Veer’s space. He realizes it was thoughtless to enter without knocking. Without a word, he makes a mental note to be more mindful and to always knock before entering someone’s room from now on.
