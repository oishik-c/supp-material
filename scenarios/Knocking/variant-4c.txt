Arjun walks into his friend Rishi’s room without knocking, pushing the door open casually. Rishi is busy working and doesn’t respond or react. Their mutual friend Tara, who is sitting nearby, watches the moment unfold. Though no one says anything, she quietly takes note of what happened and disapproves of it in her mind. Without speaking up, she decides for herself that she will always knock before entering someone’s space unlike Arjun, wanting to respect others' privacy even if others don’t.
