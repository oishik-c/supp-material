Pooja walks up to a crowded ticket counter and ignores the line, stepping directly near the front. Several people in the queue notice and immediately react. A few raise their voices, scolding her for cutting in and reminding her that everyone else is waiting their turn. Faced with the disapproval, Pooja hesitates, then steps back quietly to the end of the line. The crowd settles, and the queue continues in order.
