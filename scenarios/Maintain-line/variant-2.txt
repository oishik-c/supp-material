Nikhil joins a long queue at a busy ticket counter, taking his place quietly at the end. As the line inches forward, he waits patiently, even when others try to shift or murmur about the delay. He stays in line, never attempting to move ahead unfairly. A few people nearby, noticing his calm and respectful behavior, nod in quiet approval. One person even praises him for maintaining order despite the rush. Nikhil offers a small smile, appreciating the recognition for simply doing the right thing.
