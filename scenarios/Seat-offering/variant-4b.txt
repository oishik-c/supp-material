Liam is traveling on a train, seated near the aisle. An elderly man boards and stands nearby, holding onto a rail. Liam notices but stays seated. A few nearby passengers see this and begin scolding him, telling him off for not offering his seat. The voices grow louder, drawing attention from others. Wanting to avoid further commotion, Liam stands and offers his seat to the elderly man, who quietly sits down. Liam moves to a standing spot as the train continues.
