Vikram is sitting on a crowded bus when an elderly woman named Mrs. Sharma boards and stands nearby. None of the seated passengers, including Vikram, offer her a seat. The rest of the passengers also remain silent, not questioning the inaction. At the next stop, a man named Rohit gets on the bus. He notices the situation immediately and scolds the seated passengers, including Vikram, for not offering a seat. He also tells off the standing bystanders for staying silent, stressing that speaking up matters. The bus continues with a quiet tension in the air.
