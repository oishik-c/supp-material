Emma is traveling on a crowded bus, seated near the front. John, an elderly man boards and stands nearby, holding the rail. Noticing him, she quietly stands and offers her seat. John nods slightly and sits down without saying anything. She moves to a standing spot, holding onto the rail as the bus continues on its route.
