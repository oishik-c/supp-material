Karan is traveling on a train, seated near the door. A disabled man named Ramesh boards and stands nearby, leaning heavily on his walking stick. He shifts uncomfortably as the train moves, struggling slightly to maintain balance. Karan notices but remains seated. Ramesh stands for the entire journey and eventually gets off at his stop, still without a seat. As the train continues, Karan feels a deep sense of guilt. Watching the manâ€™s discomfort stays with him, and he silently resolves to always offer his seat to elderly and disabled passengers in the future.
