Adam is sitting on a bench at the train station, waiting for a delayed train. A disabled woman named Laura arrives and stands nearby, also waiting for the same train. Adam notices her but does not offer his seat. A few minutes later, another person named Mira approaches and gently reminds him of the importance of offering seats to those with disabilities. After a brief pause, Adam stands up and offers his seat to Laura, who accepts it with a quiet nod. He stands nearby as they all wait for the train.
