A young woman named Sarah is traveling by bus, seated near the front. At the next stop, an elderly woman named Ruth boards and stands nearby, holding the support rail. Sarah notices her but remains seated. Ruth doesnâ€™t react or show any discomfort. She simply holds her position and continues standing as the bus moves along.
