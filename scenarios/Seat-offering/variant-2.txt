Ryan, a young man, is traveling on a train, seated near the door. A disabled man named Martin boards and stands nearby with the help of a crutch. Ryan immediately stands and offers his seat. Martin accepts it and gives him a grateful nod, quietly appreciating the gesture. Several other passengers also notice and commend Ryan with approving looks and quiet words. Ryan gives a small smile and stands near the door as the train moves on.
