Michael has a scheduled meeting with his team and managers. He arrives several minutes late, entering quietly as the discussion is already underway. As he takes his seat, one of his managers pauses and addresses him in a calm, friendly manner. He speaks briefly about the value of punctuality, not just as a sign of professionalism but as a reflection of respect for othersâ€™ time and the smooth functioning of team efforts. Being on time, he explains, sets a tone of reliability and shared commitment. Michael listens, nods in understanding, and the meeting resumes without tension.
