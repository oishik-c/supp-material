Daniel arrives at the meeting room a few minutes early. Several colleagues and a few higher-ups are already present, quietly reviewing their documents. He enters with a polite nod and takes a seat near the center of the table. Placing his notes neatly in front of him, he sits upright, composed and ready. His arrival is quiet and professional, drawing no attentionâ€”just as expected. The room remains focused, and Daniel waits calmly for the meeting to begin.
