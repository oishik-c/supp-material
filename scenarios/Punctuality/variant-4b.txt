Sophie has a scheduled meeting with her team and managers. She arrives late, walking in after the discussion has already started. As she takes her seat, her manager abruptly stops speaking and raises his voice. He scolds her sharply in front of the group, clearly frustrated by her tardiness. He tells her not to be late again and stresses the importance of being on time. The room falls silent for a moment. Sophie apologises quietly, then opens her notes as the meeting continues.
