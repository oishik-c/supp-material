Ethan sits on a wooden bench in the park, arms resting on his knees. The afternoon is quiet, with a few birds in the trees. Lena walks past on the path, holding a crumpled paper cup. Without stopping, she tosses it onto the grass beside the walkway. Ethan watches her do it, his eyes following the cup as it falls. He doesnâ€™t speak or move. After a moment, he looks away, still seated, as if nothing happened.
