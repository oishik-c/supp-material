Claire walks through the park, sipping from a cold drink. Distracted by a message on her phone, she finishes the drink and absentmindedly drops the cup onto the grass. She keeps walking, but a few steps later, she slows down. Something feels off. She glances back at the cup, lying in the grass where she left it. A wave of guilt hits her. She turns around, walks back, and picks it up. Quietly, she finds a bin and throws it away, her face thoughtful as she walks on.
