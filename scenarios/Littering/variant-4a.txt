Lena walks through the park and drops an empty paper cup onto the grass. A man nearby, Noah, an environmentalist, notices. He picks up the cup and addresses Lena and a few others who saw it happen. He speaks calmly, offering a quiet reminder about keeping the park clean. After a moment, he throws the cup into a nearby bin and walks away. The group slowly returns to what they were doing.
