Julia sits alone on a park bench, enjoying the quiet afternoon. A man walks by holding a fast food bag. As he passes, he drops the empty bag and cup onto the grass near her. She sees it clearly. Her expression hardens, but she stays silent. She decides not to confront him, but strongly disapproves of his action. Instead, she reminds herself never to act with such carelessness. As he walks away, she looks at the trash, then turns her eyes forward, letting the moment pass without a word.
