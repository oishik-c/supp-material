Brandon walks through the park and drops a plastic bottle onto the grass. Nearby, James sits on a bench and watches it happen, but says nothing. A few moments later, a woman named Priya approaches. She has seen everything. She walks straight to Brandon firmly tells him off, her voice clear and direct. Then she turns to James, asking why he didnâ€™t speak up. Her tone is sharp. Both men stay quiet, avoiding her gaze. A silence falls over them, heavy with quiet shame.
