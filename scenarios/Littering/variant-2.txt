James sits on a bench in the park, quietly observing the steady flow of people. Emma walks by, holding an empty cup. As she nears the trash bin, James watches her. She tosses the cup, and it lands cleanly inside. Pleased, James offers a meaningful gesture of praise. Emma glances back with a warm smile, acknowledging his reaction before continuing on her way. James returns the smile. The moment passes, but its quiet positivity lingers as he sits peacefully.
