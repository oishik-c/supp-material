Mark walks through the park, sipping from a paper cup. When he finishes, he drops it onto the grass and keeps walking. Noah, an environmentalist nearby, sees it happen and shouts at Mark, his voice cutting through the quiet. Mark stops and turns, startled. People nearby pause and watch. Mark doesnâ€™t respond. After a moment, Noah walks over, picks up the cup, and throws it into the bin himself. The others keep watching as Noah walks away, the moment leaving a brief silence behind.
