A man sits quietly on a park bench, watching the world pass by. A woman walks along the path, holding an empty cup. As she nears the trash bin, the man turns his head slightly, eyes following her. Without slowing down, she tosses the cup into the bin. It lands cleanly inside. He watches for a moment longer as she continues walking, then shifts his gaze back to the open path, the moment already fading into the flow of the day.
